## Instructions

This is a project for the FrontEnd Nanodegree program at Udacity.

The game has full functionality and can be experienced by downloading the zip file and opening the index.html file on a browser. The game only works properly with full content of the .zip file where the HTML (index.html), the styling (app.css) and the script files (app.js) can be found.

For specific, references on the assignment, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

The starter code was taken from the https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game repository and it's used for _all_ Udacity students.
